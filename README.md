# GlintSolar_test_task

This is a repository for the test case for the interview with GlintSolar. 

The Jupyter notebook demonstrates the result of the data query for the first task and a test GET request to the API. 

To run the Flask application locally, just run the command below, making sure that the requirements are installed and the templates folder is in the same directory that the app. 
``` python app.py ```

The React project hosted on GitHub pages currently does not an implementation with the GET requests.
